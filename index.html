        <p><b>In meteorology</b>, the study of atmospheric weather phenomena, a <mark>cloud</mark><br>
        is an aerosol comprising a visible mass of <big>minute liquid droplets</big> or<br>
        <big>frozen crystals</big>,both of which are made of water or various chemicals. The droplets or particles<br>
        are suspended in the atmosphere above the surface of a planetary body.<br> 
        On Earth, clouds are formed by the saturation of air in the homosphere<br> 
        (which includes the troposphere, stratosphere, and mesosphere) when air cools or gains water vapor.<br> 
        The science of clouds is nephology which is undertaken in the cloud physics branch of meteorology
